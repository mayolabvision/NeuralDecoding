#### Decoders to run: ####

6 models: WF, SVR, DNN, RNN, GRU, LSTM
1. Basic performance of each with all of the data (R2, reconstructed traces, etc...)
    - 6 models (0,3,4,5,6,7)
    - 10 sessions
2. Show that more data = better performance, as expected
    - range of percentages of total number of trials
    - 6 models
    - 10 sessions
3. Cross-decoding across stimulus conditions
    - target speeds, stimulus contrasts, target directions
    - 6 models
    - 10 sessions
4. Cross-decoding across behavioral ypes
    - trials with "purest" pursuit, trials with more velocity variability
    - 6 models
    - 10 sessions

#### Plots: ####
1. Intro/intuition, behavioral variability
2. Pipeline of methods
3. True/predicted eye traces, R2 of each model with all of the data, R2 increases with more data
4. Confusion matrix --> 3 conceptual drawings (train/test sets), 3 plots (speed, contrast, direction)
5. Confusion matrix --> 1 conceptual drawing (train/test sets), 1 plot (saccadey, pursuity, mixed)
